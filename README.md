## Project definition
This project focused on comparing a SQL and NoSQL database regarding data structure, querying, indexing and optimizations.

### Database Infrastructure:
- **Relational Database:** SQLite
- **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB

### Data:
The data for this project had to be arbitrarily chosen considering that it must contain three distinct excel sheets with at least a common column.

The dataset chosen was the "World Happiness Report" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness), which consists in five csv files with variables related to the happiness index of given countries over the span of 5 years.

The data files were slighlty modified to homogenize their format.

### Project Objectives:
- Select the dataset and database schemas
- Create the databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- Create 6 queries for each database
- Create indexes, optimize the queries and database schemas and compare performance results

This project was developed using Python and the following libraries: Pandas, SQLite3 and PyMongo.
